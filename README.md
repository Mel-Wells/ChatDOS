# ChatDOS

ChatDOS is a minimalist, no-frills chatroom platform that brings back the nostalgia of early internet communication. Although it is currently non-functional and was developed as part of a web design challenge, there are plans to evolve it into a fully functioning application where users can interact via chat or forum.

## Features

- **90s Design:** Experience a user interface reminiscent of the early internet era, but with a modern twist.

## Future Features

- **Instant Access:** Users will be able to create an account and start engaging immediately.
- **Interactive Elements:** More interactive features will be added, such as draggable windows.
- **Chat Integration:** Real-time chat capabilities will be integrated into the website.
- **Forum Integration:** For users who prefer asynchronous discussion, a local forum with various topics will be available.

## Software and Assets Used

- **HTML & CSS:** For overall structure, styling, and interactions.
- **JavaScript:** To create dynamic, interactive elements.
- **Git:** For version control.
- **Pixlr:** For image editing.
- **GifCities**
- **Pexels**

## Issues Encountered

Initially, the project included terminal-style windows that could be dragged around. However, this feature interfered with the overall design by causing erratic window movements. This functionality has been removed for now and is slated for reimplementation in a future update.

## What's Next

The next phase is to develop a system that keeps interested users updated on the project's progress. Users will be able to submit their name and email through a form to receive updates.
