            <h3>The Lore</h3>
            <p class>In a time long before social media and cellphones, connecting with friends online meant logging into an internet chat room or forum. 
                Its charm lay in its simplicity and unhurried pace, letting you connect with people from around the globe on your own terms and disconnecting. 
                In today's world of relentless notifications and constant chatter, the idea sounds archaic and even insane, however, it's a beautiful thing that should be 
                celebrated and normalized again. Which leads us to ChatDOS.
            </p>
            <h3>The Philosophy</h3>
            <p class="cursor-effect">The philosophy behind ChatDOS is simple: break free from being confined to a smartphone and rediscover the beauty of the Dotcom days and having your own peace. 
                Back then, you used different devices for games, movies, music—even phone calls—creating unique, focused experiences. 
                Today, everything fits in your pocket, and we're constantly bombarded with distractions. So, grab your favorite beverage, kick back, and chat like it's 1999 and remember, just because it's old 
                doesn't mean it has to be boring. Reject modernity and help create a new web era with us.
